## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS preprocessor
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- The challenge was very good for me. I needed to look around, research, and learn a lot of new things that helped me become a better programmer! The hardest part for me was the regular expressions and passing the data to another component with React state hooks (the answer
to 'what i learned'). However, I did my best, and I am very proud of the results!
